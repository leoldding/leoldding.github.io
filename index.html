        <p>While discussing ideas for a course group project, the idea of a spam message classification model came up. Unfortunately, the idea did not align well with the course's scope, thus it was scrapped. I still thought it was an interesting idea so I went to make this spam classification model myself.</p>

      <p>In the fall/winter of 2020, I worked with a small group of other college students from USC, UCLA, and UC Berkeley to propose an automated experiment regarding virulence and antibiotic resistance in E. coli in microgravity environments to the NASA SPOCS board. I was in charge of deciding what types of data should be collected, the amount of data needed, and what types of analysis would be done once the experiment concluded.</p>
